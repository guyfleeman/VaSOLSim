This folder contains finished executables for the VaSolSim. If you are looking to download the program you are in the right spot.

The .jar files require Java 7 or later to run.

They follow the naming convention (major version).(minor version).(build number)-VaSolSim.jar. Generally speaking which ever (assuming there is more than one file) has the highest value for major version is the jar you want to run. As long as Java 7 is installed. Simply double click the jar file. If you have any inquiries, please email me at guyfleeman@gmail.com with the subject header "VaSOLSim help".
